# Task-1-Student_Score_Prediction_Using_Supervised_ML
The Sparks Foundation- Task 1- Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables. It predicts the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours. Currently it predicts with an accuracy of 91.57%. In this I have used the Linear Regression Algorithm here which is imported directly from SciKit Learn module in Python. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
